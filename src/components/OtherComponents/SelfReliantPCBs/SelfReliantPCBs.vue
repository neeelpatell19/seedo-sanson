              <strong>Seedo</strong>, in partnership with its strategic ally, has achieved a
              significant milestone by designing and producing its own PCBs using
              cutting-edge pick-and-place technology. This advancement enables us to
              manufacture <strong>50%</strong> of our <strong>PCBs</strong> in-house— a major
              step toward self-reliance and efficiency.

              Our PCB materials meet global safety standards, providing surge, voltage,
              and heat protection. They are <strong>phthalate-free, lead-free, and
              ROHS-compliant</strong> for international exports, ensuring safety and
              reliability in every product we create.
